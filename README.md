# Cypress-Automation

This project was created to test login and registration scenarios on the website "https://demo.borland.com/InsuranceWebExtJS/". The tools used include NodeJS, JavaScript, Cypress, and Cypress Cloud.

* Cypress is an open-source JavaScript test framework used for end-to-end (E2E) testing of web applications. Cypress aims to enable fast and reliable testing of the functionality of web applications through tests that run directly in the browser. It has the capability to mimic the real user experience on the browser, providing access not only to all browser applications but also to back-end and APIs.

* Cypress Cloud enables the distribution, management, and reporting of test automations on a remote server upon purchase. Users benefit from multi-browser and device support, fast execution of test automations, regular reruns of test automations, and the establishment of a shared workspace for test automations.
